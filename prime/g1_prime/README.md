# G1 PRIME covariance calibration

Reproducible bilevel covariance calibration for a Unitree G1 humanoid state
estimator. The lower problem is a fixed-inertia PRIME FDDP estimate with
smoothed second-order-cone contact Newton solves; the upper problem minimizes a
fixed SE(3)-log trajectory loss with SQP--BFGS or Frank--Wolfe--SDP.

| Calibrated clip | Default replay | Normal speed | Local MuJoCo viewer |
|---|---|---|---|
| run1 | [Meshcat at 0.5x](https://dlinc3.github.io/LegBiCal/media/run1_calibrated.html) | [Meshcat at 1x](https://dlinc3.github.io/LegBiCal/media/run1_calibrated.html?speed=1) | `g1cal replay --clip run1` |
| run2 | [Meshcat at 0.5x](https://dlinc3.github.io/LegBiCal/media/run2_calibrated.html) | [Meshcat at 1x](https://dlinc3.github.io/LegBiCal/media/run2_calibrated.html?speed=1) | `g1cal replay --clip run2` |

The visualizations are built on top of PRIME's excellent estimator
(well-robotics/PRIME, BSD-3). Half speed is the default so that contact forces
remain easy to inspect; each page also has `0.5x` and `1x` controls.

The covariance was calibrated by directly minimizing the SE(3)-log trajectory
loss on the two released 501-state running clips; no accuracy beyond these two
clips is claimed.

## Results

Only the joint-position measurement block is released in the upper problem;
the other 16 covariance coordinates remain at the declared baseline.

| Quantity | Initial | Calibrated |
|---|---:|---:|
| Aggregate SE(3)-log loss | 0.013567787042 | **0.013564704612** |
| run1 loss | 0.011790493739 | **0.011788640734** |
| run2 loss | 0.015345080346 | **0.015340768489** |
| Joint-position sigma | 0.040000020 rad | **0.039944588 rad** |

The released coordinate is `theta[13] = 1.3849080667587708`, corresponding
to variance `0.0015955701021633114` and precision `626.7352331584658`.

## Quickstart

The default demo reads the shipped calibrated solution bundles and creates
self-contained Meshcat HTML without running the estimator or a simulator.

```bash
# Run from this directory.
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate g1cal
./scripts/build.sh
python -m pip install -e .
g1cal demo --out out/demo
```

To rerun one lower problem at the released covariance:

```bash
g1cal solve --clip run1 --covariance data/calibrated/precision.csv
g1cal solve --clip run2 --covariance calibrated
```

The interactive MuJoCo path prescribes `qpos`/`qvel` and calls `mj_forward` at
50 Hz; it does not advance MuJoCo dynamics.

```bash
g1cal replay --clip run1 --source calibrated
```

## Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `g1cal demo` | Render both shipped calibrated solutions to Meshcat HTML |
| `g1cal solve` | Run one lower estimator at a selected covariance |
| `g1cal calibrate` | Run SQP--BFGS or Frank--Wolfe--SDP upper updates |
| `g1cal select` | Select the lowest strict evaluated covariance |
| `g1cal render` | Render one saved solution to self-contained Meshcat HTML |
| `g1cal replay` | Open the passive interactive MuJoCo viewer |

Use `g1cal COMMAND --help` for the exact arguments.

## Reproduce the calibration

Both upper methods share a content-addressed two-clip oracle, immutable lower
attempts, a strict promotion gate, and the whole-estimator central finite
difference in the released direction. Runtime depends on hardware and the
available lower-evaluation cache.

```bash
g1cal calibrate --optimizer sqp-bfgs --max-iterations 2 \
  --out out/calibration
g1cal calibrate --optimizer frank-wolfe-sdp --max-iterations 2 \
  --out out/calibration
g1cal select --out out/calibration
```

The Frank--Wolfe linear minimization oracle is solved as an SDP and checked
against the analytic interval endpoint for the released isotropic scalar.

## Verification

```bash
scripts/verify_release.sh
```

This builds the native targets, runs six C++ tests and the Python suite,
validates data and scenes, performs a render smoke, builds the Pages artifact,
and checks repository file sizes. `scripts/verify_release.sh --full` also runs
both lower solves and one iteration of each upper method. Until the motion-data
publication marker records authorization, technical verification intentionally
finishes with status `3`; see [`data/clips/README.md`](data/clips/README.md).
